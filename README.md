# ✅ Microservices with Spring Boot – Learning Checklist

Track your hands-on journey to mastering microservices with Spring Boot. This roadmap breaks down the path into focused learning phases with projects.

---

## 📘 Phase 1: Prerequisites – Spring Boot & REST
- [ ] Java 8+ (Lambdas, Streams, Optionals)
- [ ] Spring Boot Basics (Starters, `@SpringBootApplication`)
- [ ] Build REST APIs with Spring Web
- [ ] Exception Handling (`@ControllerAdvice`)
- [ ] **Mini Project**: Product Catalog REST API (CRUD)

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: Core Microservices Concepts
- [ ] Understand Microservices Architecture
- [ ] Break monolith into microservices (`Product`, `Order`, `Payment`)
- [ ] Service Communication using:
  - [ ] REST Template
  - [ ] WebClient
  - [ ] Feign Client
- [ ] **Hands-On**: Call Product-Service from Order-Service

---

## 🧭 Phase 3: Service Discovery & API Gateway
- [ ] Implement Eureka Server
- [ ] Register services in Eureka
- [ ] Set up Spring Cloud Gateway
- [ ] Route requests via API Gateway
- [ ] Load Balancing using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Centralized Configuration
- [ ] Create Spring Cloud Config Server
- [ ] Store config in Git repository
- [ ] Externalize properties from microservices
- [ ] Use `@RefreshScope` and Actuator `/refresh` endpoint

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Resilience & Fault Tolerance
- [ ] Add Resilience4j (Circuit Breaker, Retry)
- [ ] Configure fallback methods
- [ ] Add timeout settings
- [ ] Rate Limiting and Bulkhead patterns

---

## 📡 Phase 6: Event-Driven Architecture
- [ ] Introduction to Kafka or RabbitMQ
- [ ] Publish/Subscribe using Spring Cloud Stream
- [ ] Produce event in Order-Service
- [ ] Consume event in Payment-Service

---

## 🔐 Phase 7: Security with Spring Security
- [ ] Implement Spring Security in microservices
- [ ] JWT Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Secure APIs with role-based access
- [ ] Integrate auth with Gateway filter

---

## 📊 Phase 8: Observability & Monitoring
- [ ] Add Spring Boot Actuator
- [ ] Enable health, metrics, info endpoints
- [ ] Distributed Tracing with Sleuth + Zipkin
- [ ] Centralized Logging using ELK Stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana)

---

## 🐳 Phase 9: Docker & Deployment
- [ ] Create Dockerfiles for all microservices
- [ ] Use Docker Compose to run full system
- [ ] Basics of Kubernetes (Optional)

---

## 🏁 Capstone Project: E-commerce Microservices System
Build a real-world system to apply everything you've learned:
- [ ] `User-Service` (Auth using JWT)
- [ ] `Product-Service`
- [ ] `Order-Service`
- [ ] `Payment-Service`
- [ ] `Notification-Service` (event-driven via Kafka)
- [ ] Centralized Config + Eureka + Gateway
- [ ] Dockerized deployment using Docker Compose
